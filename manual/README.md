## Manual Folder

This is where you put packages that are manually kept up to date or don't require updates. Icons still go in the icon folder.

Packages:
  - [`javadecompiler-gui`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/javadecompiler-gui)
  - [`openjdk.portable`](https://chocolatey.org/packages/openjdk.portable)

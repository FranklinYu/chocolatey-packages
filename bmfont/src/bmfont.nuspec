    <summary>This program will allow you to generate bitmap fonts from TrueType fonts. The application generates both image files and character descriptions that can be read by a game for easy rendering of fonts. The program is freeware and open source, but a donation is greatly appreciated.</summary>
    <description>Features
	Support for complete Unicode 6.2 character set, as well as 8 bit OEM character sets
	Optimal use of texture space, i.e. as little unused area as possible
	Support for kerning pairs
	Easy to use file format, either normal text file or xml files. Binary format is available for those that prefer that
	8bit or 32bit texture output (TGA, PNG, and DDS files)
	Option for packing 4 layers of font images into 1 32bit texture. Needs special shader to render with, but saves a lot of memory
	Anti-aliasing, both through Windows native font smoothing and super sampling
	Configurable padding and spacing between characters
	Select characters from text file, supports both UTF8 and UTF16 encoded files
	Generate bitmap font from command line
	Import colored images as characters, supports: bmp, jpg, tga, dds, png
	Optional outline to font characters
	Optional packing of characters with outline into 1 channel. Needs special shader to unpack during rendering, but saves a lot of memory
	Use TrueType fonts directly from the file without installing them first</description>

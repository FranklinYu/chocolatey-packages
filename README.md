This contains Chocolatey packages, both manually and automatically maintained. You can use AU (Automatic Updater), currently supported in the Chocolatey community, for automatic packaging.

## Folder Structure

* automatic - where automatic packaging and packages are kept. These are packages that are automatically maintained using AU.
* icons - Where you keep icon files for the packages. This is done to reduce issues when packages themselves move around.
* manual - where packages that are not automatic are kept.
* setup - items for prepping the system to ensure for auto packaging.

For setting up your own automatic package repository, please see [Automatic Packaging](https://chocolatey.org/docs/automatic-packages)

## Requirements

* Chocolatey (choco.exe)
* PowerShell v5+.
* The [AU module](https://chocolatey.org/packages/au).

For daily operations check out the AU packages template ReadMe.
